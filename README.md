<h1 >OnlineShoppingApplication</h1>

  In this Online Shopping Application,I have implemented registration and 
Login features using SQLite database.

#

  After Successful of Login when user enters in an application , The layout
is sidebar navigation drawer. Header of side bar drawer display User name 
and email which he/she entered during registration time. And Another Fields 
are "Home", "Account Info" "Cart" & "Sign Out"

#

  Screen of Home Page will display list of the items for shopping. On Click of 
red cart icon user will add that items in cart list. After once added in cart 
it changes that icon to green colour instead of red and it will display text "already in cart".

#

  From side bar drawer menu when user choose Account information then it will
display one simple UI that Display User Full name, Email Address, Contact
Number, Full Address of Delivery with State and pin code number.Here Name and
Email are same which he/she entered during registration/login time but other fiels are static.

#

   When  user choose cart option from side bar, it will display items added in cart by
user. On click of Place order simple Toast message that "Your order has successfully placed" 
will display on the screen.

#

And on Sign Out Action the user will move to Login Page .
