<h1 >OnlineShoppingApplication</h1>

  This is an Online Shopping Application that includes registration and login features using an SQLite database.

#

Upon successful login, the application presents a sidebar navigation drawer layout. The header of the sidebar displays the user's name and email, which were entered during the registration process. The sidebar also contains the following fields: "Home," "Account Info," "Cart," and "Sign Out."

#

 The Home Page screen displays a list of items available for shopping. When the user clicks on the red cart icon, the item is added to their cart list. Once an item is added to the cart, the cart icon changes to green, and the text "already in cart" is displayed.

#

 By selecting the "Account Info" option from the sidebar drawer menu, the user is shown a simple UI that displays their full name, email address, contact number, and complete delivery address including state and pin code. The name and email fields are the same as the ones entered during registration/login, while the other fields are static.
#

When the user chooses the "Cart" option from the sidebar, the application displays the items added to the cart. Clicking on the "Place Order" button triggers a simple toast message that says, "Your order has been successfully placed."

#

Finally, selecting the "Sign Out" action takes the user back to the Login Page.
